# Wine-Quality-Analisys

In our wine quality prediction project, we employed two machine learning classifiers, namely the Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier, to forecast the wine quality based on specific composition parameters.

The results were remarkable, with the Random Forest Classifier exhibiting outstanding performance, achieving an accuracy of over 99%. This model demonstrated its robustness in handling complex relationships among the input features, thereby providing highly accurate predictions.

On the other hand, the Decision Tree Classifier yielded a comparatively lower accuracy of around 60%. This discrepancy in performance can be attributed to its simpler structure and potential overfitting to the training data, limiting its ability to generalize well to new instances.

In conclusion, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the superior choice for predicting wine quality due to its exceptional accuracy and ability to capture intricate patterns within the data. The project's success reinforces the significance of utilizing sophisticated ensemble methods like Random Forest in data science tasks involving complex datasets with multiple interdependent variables.
